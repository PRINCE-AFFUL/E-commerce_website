Write a program that tells what coins to give out for any amount of change from 1 cent to 99 cents. For example, if the amount is 86 cents, the output would be something like the following: 86 cents can be given as 3 quarter(s) 1 dime(s) and 1 penny(pennies) Use coin denominations of 25 cents (quarters), 10 cents (dimes), and 1 cent (pennies). Do not use nickel and half-dollar coins. Your program will use the following function (among others): void computeCoin(int coinValue, int& number, int& amountLeft); //Precondition: 0 < coinValue < 100; 0 <= amountLeft < 100. //Postcondition: number has been set equal to the maximum number //of coins of denomination coinValue cents that can be obtained //from amountLeft cents. amountLeft has been decreased by the //value of the coins, that is, decreased by number*coinValue. For example, suppose the value of the variable amountLeft is 86. Then, after the following call, the value of number will be 3 and the value of amountLeft will be 11 (because if you take three quarters from 86 cents, that leaves 11 cents): computeCoins(25, number, amountLeft);
