4. Negotiating a consumer loan is not always straightforward. One form of loan is the dis- count installment loan, which works as follows. Suppose a loan has a face value of $1,000, the interest rate is 15%, and the duration is 18 months. The interest is computed by multi- plying the face value of $1,000 by 0.15, yielding $150. That figure is then multiplied by the loan period of 1.5 years to yield $225 as the total interest owed. That amount is imme- diately deducted from the face value, leaving the consumer with only $775. Repayment is made in equal monthly installments based on the face value. So the monthly loan payment will be $1,000 divided by 18, which is $55.56. This method of calculation may not be too bad if the consumer needs $775 dollars, but the calculation is a bit more complicated if the consumer needs $1,000. Write a program that will take three inputs: the amount the con- sumer needs to receive, the interest rate, and the duration of the loan in months. The pro- gram should then calculate the face value required in order for the consumer to receive the amount needed. It should also calculate the monthly payment.
