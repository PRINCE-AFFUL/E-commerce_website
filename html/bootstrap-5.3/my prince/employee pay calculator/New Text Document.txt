6. An employee is paid at a rate of $16.78 per hour for regular hours worked in a week.
 Any hours over that are paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half times that. From the worker’s gross pay, 
6% is withheld for Social Security tax, 14% is withheld for federal
income tax, 5% is withheld for state income tax, and $10 per week is withheld for union dues. If the worker has three or more dependents, then an additional $35 is withheld to cover the extra cost of health insurance beyond what the employer pays. Write a program that will read in the number of hours worked in a week and the number of dependents as input and that will then output the worker’s gross pay, each withholding amount, and the net take-home pay for the week.
