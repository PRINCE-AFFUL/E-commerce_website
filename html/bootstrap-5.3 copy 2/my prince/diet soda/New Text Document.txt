2. A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly used in diet soda will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda. Your friend wants to know how much diet soda it is possible to drink without dying as a result. Write a program to supply the answer. The input to the program is the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a mouse, the weight of the mouse, and the weight of the dieter. To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the pro- gram requests the weight at which the dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieterâ€™s cur- rent weight. Assume that diet soda contains one-tenth of 1% artificial sweetener. Use a variable declaration with the modifier const to give a name to this fraction. You may want to express the percentage as the double value 0.001.
